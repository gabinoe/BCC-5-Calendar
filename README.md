# Work Day Scheduler

The "Work Day Scheduler" is a professional and user-friendly calendar application that users use to create and organize their daily work schedules. It presents time blocks for standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM) and intuitively color-codes each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The application allows users to seamlessly enter events or tasks for each time block, and all entered data is automatically saved in local storage, ensuring that the schedule persists across page refreshes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Real-Time Display**: The application prominently displays the current day at the top of the calendar, keeping users aware of the present date while planning their work day.

- **Intuitive Time Blocks**: Scroll down to view time blocks thoughtfully designed for standard business hours. Each time block is visually color-coded to signify its temporal relation to the current hour—gray for past, red for present, and green for future—offering users immediate context.

- **Seamless Event Input**: Users can effortlessly click into any time block to enter events or tasks for that specific hour. The textarea element's design ensures a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing input experience.

- **Persistent Data**: All entered events are securely stored in local storage upon clicking the save button (indicated by a floppy disk icon). As a result, the schedule remains intact even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
